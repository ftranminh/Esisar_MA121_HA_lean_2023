Summary : Short module introducing proof to 1st year undergraduates using Lean3 - in French
Experience : 
   - 1st time we use a proof assistant to teach maths
   - students globally appreciated it (feedback, autonomy, playful)
   - some of them think it helped them with maths
   - found the Lean syntax difficult (they also tended to attribute their shortcomings in maths to a programming difficulties)
   - found the Lean error messages helpless
